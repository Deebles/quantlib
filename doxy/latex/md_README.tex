Contributing is easy. Get a Git\+Hub account if you don\textquotesingle{}t have it already and clone this repository with the \char`\"{}\+Fork\char`\"{} button in the top right corner of this page. Check out your clone to your machine, code away, push your changes to your clone and submit a pull request; instructions are available at \href{https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo}{\tt https\+://help.\+github.\+com/articles/fork-\/a-\/repo}. (In case you need them, more detailed instructions for creating pull requests are at \href{https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests}{\tt https\+://help.\+github.\+com/articles/using-\/pull-\/requests}, and a basic guide to Git\+Hub is at \href{https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/}{\tt https\+://guides.\+github.\+com/activities/hello-\/world/}.)

It\textquotesingle{}s likely that we won\textquotesingle{}t merge your code right away, and we\textquotesingle{}ll ask for some changes instead. Don\textquotesingle{}t be discouraged! That\textquotesingle{}s normal; the library is complex, and thus it might take some time to become familiar with it and to use it in an idiomatic way.

We\textquotesingle{}re looking forward to your contributions.
